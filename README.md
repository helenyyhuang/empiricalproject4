# Empirical Project 4 - Using Google DataCommons to Predict Social Mobility
This repository contains my work on Empirical Project 4 from Prof. Raj Chetty's Big Data course, which is publicly accessible at [Opportunity Insights Course website](https://opportunityinsights.org/course/). The project focuses on using Google DataCommons to predict intergenerational mobility with machine learning methods, particularly targeting the mean rank of a child from the 25th percentile of the national income distribution in each county.

## Technologies Used
- **Anaconda**: A Python environment with Jupyter Notebook is required for interacting with the project.
- Installation: Visit the [Anaconda website](https://www.anaconda.com/download) to download and install Anaconda for your operating system.
- Launching Jupyter Notebook: After installing Anaconda, launch Jupyter Notebook via Anaconda; it will open in your default web browser, where you can create and manage notebooks.
- Accessing the Project: In the web browser, navigate to the folder where you've downloaded this repository. Open the `.ipynb` file named `empiricalproject4_helen.ipynb`.

## How to Use
1. Download the repository by clicking the 'Code' button and selecting 'Download ZIP' at the top right corner.
2. Extract the ZIP file on your computer.
3. Open and run the Jupyter Notebook (`empiricalproject4_helen.ipynb`) for an interactive analysis.
4. Alternatively, view the `empiricalproject4_helen.pdf` for a static representation of the Jupyter Notebook's content, ideal for non-interactive viewing.
5. For any queries or assistance, feel free to contact me at yhuan199@alumni.jh.edu.

## Usage
- `project4.docx`: Original assignment with detailed instructions and questions.
- `empiricalproject4_helen.ipynb`: My detailed analysis and results.
- `empiricalproject4_helen.pdf`: A non-interactive, detailed view of the analysis and results, mirroring the content in the Jupyter Notebook.
- `1-5predictors.csv`, `6-10predictors.csv`, `atlas_training.dta`, `atlas_test.dta`: The datasets used for the analysis.
- `training_data_descrip.pdf`: Description of the training dataset.
- `project4_prep_data_for_R_v2.do`, `SuperLearner.R`, `proj4.R`, `datacommons_cdc_deaths.csv`: Files included in the original download package but were not utilized in this analysis.
